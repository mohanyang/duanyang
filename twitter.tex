\begin{abstract}
Targeting user profile to match a user with specific services is a fundamental task for social network system. In this paper we are given a set of users within a category $\mathcal{C}$ and would like to infer which users are also in this category with high probability. We show that the information contained in graph structure and tweets are highly related to users profile. We develop several algorithms and design the co-training framework based on bidirectional snowball algorithm and naive Bayes algorithm. Our experiments on Twitter social network show that our approaches performs well in retrieving users within target category.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Effectively estimating user profile and accordingly recommending service or suggesting friends are fundamental to all social networks. In this report, we have shown that the user's short bio is highly related with user's friendship information and user's tweets. We presented three simple ranking approaches and a co-training framework that leverage both friendship and tweets evidence to solve the task purposed in our report. The graph approach analysis user profile from his friendship since that similar users are more likely to connected with each other. The Bayes approach extract the semantics of individual message that allow for the generation of user information of a given concept. Given the co-training framework, it is easily for us to combine two different models and obtain a better ranking result with less positive training examples. The experiments results on twitter demonstrate that simple algorithms performs very well for our problem. From the discussion, we learned the pros and cons of different approaches.

The co-training framework that combines graph information and tweets information are not limited to predict user hidden profiles, and can be applied to many other problems that require learning to rank nodes in a graph. There are some interest future research directions: First, the users are equally important in our model based on graph structure. However, we find many inactive users during our labeling process. We may assume users have different weight during the training process. Thus, there may exists the underlying mechanism of how the interactions and information between users related to their personal profile. Second, it is interesting to apply our algorithms in friends recommendation system. Currently, most friend recommendation systems were based on number of users' mutual friends. The co-training approach could leverage users' mutual friends information and other users' behavior such as tweets, profile. I think it is very helpful for building such framework for friends recommendation.
